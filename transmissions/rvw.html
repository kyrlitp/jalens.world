    roe v. wade had just fallen. i was 23. i thought maybe i was being dramatic. i wasn’t.<br>
    this is part of the archive — a signal from before it broke.
  </span>

  <p><strong>we’re in really tough times. here’s why it is important, now more than ever, that you create.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>ROE V WADE WAS JUST OVERTURNED.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>THINGS ARE LOOKING HORRIBLE FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I GIVE THE COUNTRY 3 MORE YEARS, BUT THAT’S JUST ME.</strong></p>

  <p>IT FEELS LIKE WE SHOULDN’T BE CREATING. IT’S A “DISTRACTION”.</p>

  <p>BUT IT’S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO.</p>

  <p>I WANT TO DISPEL THE IDEA THAT OUR ART IS SOMEHOW GOING TO “CHANGE” THE WORLD, AND HOW THINGS ARE.</p>

  <p>THAT MAY BE WHAT THE HIGHEST PROFILE ARTISTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO, BUT NOT US.</p>

  <p>INSTEAD, WE HAVE A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE ARGUABLY —</p>

  <p><strong>TO SHOW A SNAPSHOT.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    <div class="indented">“WHO WERE THESE PEOPLE, LIVING IN 2022? WHAT WERE THEY LIKE?<br>
      WHAT WERE THEIR HOPES?<br>
      <span class="indented">DREAMS?<br>
        <span class="indented">DESIRES?<br>
          <span class="indented">WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?<br>
            <span class="indented">DID THEY SOUND LIKE ME?<br>
              <span class="indented">DID THEY ACT LIKE ME?<br>
                <span class="indented">HOW AM I DIFFERENT FROM THEM?<br>
                  <span class="indented">AM I DIFFERENT FROM THEM?<br>
                    <span class="indented">COULD WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM<br>
                      HAPPEN TO ME?”</span>
                  </span>
                </span>
              </span>

  <p>IT’S ONE THING TO READ ABOUT YOUR ANCESTORS IN A HISTORY BOOK.</p>

  <p>IT’S ANOTHER TO HEAR THEIR VOICES.<br>
    SEE THEIR CLOTHES.<br>
    WATCH VIDEOS OF THEM.</p>

  <p>THE ANCESTOR JUMPS OFF THE PAGE AND SMILES OR CRIES.</p>

  <p>THE OBSERVER LEARNS SOMETHING FROM THEIR REACTION.</p>

  <p><strong>THIS TOO SHALL PASS, AND SO THE ART WE CREATE TODAY TELLS THE STORY OF WHAT IS/WAS/WILL HAPPEN IN THIS MOMENT.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>AND THAT’S WORTH SOMETHING.</strong></p>
