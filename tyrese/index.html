Tyrese Haliburton tore his Achilles last night 
and I couldn’t help but think of the O on his back
 being the letter of my hometown 
which is why Lillard wore it 
and the chances people thought the Celtics had
 of regaining their dynasty led by a man 
with a weird reverse corkscrew jumper
which is why he wore 0 too
</div>
<div class="stanza">
And in 2017 no way Philly trades the first pick
But they did
I wonder if Danny traded out of it
cuz Markelle rode motorcycles
And Jayson was tying ties instead
</div>
<div class="stanza">
And the image was just better for the brand
And I still remember the snare of the army band
As my JSOC Dad after he came back from Afghanistan
Reminded his two sons
that first time is an occurrence
	second time is a coincidence
		and third is now pattern.
 </div>
 
<div class="stanza">
And when I watched his face contort
As he processed Icarus in real time
I couldn’t help but think of all of the threes
from thirty
in all those big games 
Steve and Steph made
Kerr told Tyrese to not change his jumpshot
Fuck. We shoulda drafted him with the second pick.
Shoulda known to never take a big
Tyrese was about to do it to em 
Make em say what the Haliburton
But then the clock struck
Midnight on the Cinderella run
One more draw of the curtain
</div>

<div class="stanza">
as I scrunch my face up in disgust
Skip skips the humanity of it all
And calls Achilles an excuse for poor performance
...
</div>

<div class="stanza">
I think of how the commissioner who does not deserve 
in this moment to be named 
put the bodies of black folks once again over the billions 
and refused to reduce the number of games 
and how I felt the same
</div>
<div class="stanza">
when my job pushed me harder and harder and harder
 over and over and over
 again across the edge taking advantage of my love of the game 
Sweet chin music! Like HBK
I smacked the ground and tried to put on a brave face 
Never let them see your shame, Jay
 be like Ty, 
be like Jayson,
 be like Dame 
and protect your masculine 
and don’t shed a tear 
even though we all saw what your Achilles just did
</div>
<div class="stanza">
I think about how my government name is Jalen
How similar to Boston´s second superstar’s it is
Was that also the same man I saw at Cal as a kid?
Once the golden child goes down
And the bear is finally slain
 I realize how expendable we all are 
regardless of how our mothers see us plain
</div>
<div class="stanza">
…little boys with such big hearts we are…
</div>
<div class="stanza">
I hate how capitalism caused this 
and how the worst things propagate the fastest 
and how the wisest 
of my friends ended their own lives
now lost to past tense 
and how the very thought of continuing on
To whatever this societal trajectory weird war cry
Wants to call itself makes me want to hurl 
all over my rose orange glasses
 that I have to wear now to tell the masses 
“I just can’t see quite right
I mean
Can you please just explain
What you wanted to show me on your screen?”
</div>
<div class="stanza">
how disgusting being right is for its very name
 because this is all so so wrong 
Somehow, it must be demanded over
 and reprimanded over and over 
and commanded to stop the madness over and over and over
and maybe made into song
</div>
<div class="stanza">
one day the spell will have to break:
Human amnesia of the cost of greed
What more horror will we be bored to see
As the Doomsday Clock may soon read quadruple zeroes too
As it becomes no longer a pattern but a fourcast 
like the Chinese had intuitively known
 fearing what comes after three - 
maybe -
we should listen finally for once
 to the foresight of those who came before us 
and maybe not let so many despots swing clubs and shout fore!
 While the rabble sits in blue and black suits
 blue and black eyed from squabbles,
quibbling and babbling about who the GOAT really is, LeBron or Mike
 while we’re all being milked for sport by the teat 
and I can’t help but think about how all my family is lactose intolerant 
and the day will come where I need to eat
 a tablet to enjoy ice cream
 I guess this is part of what it means to be Black 
But what does that even mean
because would Indy have had Haliburton’s back 
if he weren’t from Oshkosh 
a name they were familiar with because that’s where they got their tools from 
And I wonder if that’s how they see him too
I fear if it was only acceptable enough
 to put him on a billboard because his skin tone’s around the same as a pale-ish paper bag
</div>
<div class="stanza">
his Dad definitely didn’t pass in the stands
Reggie Miller never had this many fans
I felt for Mr. H as he could only put his head in his hands
as the tears from the greek Gods turned to laughs
As the Thunder came
When will we ever get revenge on Master?
</div>
<div class="stanza">
I feel so green as an adult at 25 
and my prefrontal cortex continues to solidify 
and I wonder why Draymond can’t get his shit together
 as all I fear is fear and disgust for whatever
 the wrinkled folk did 
to such young bodies 
forced to become old souls
 I wish I could turn back time 
warn Ty 
shake Obi from NY
by the shoulders and tell him it was never his fault 
he was only doing his job and running the play
but that same sentence has led to so many evils
As we are unbalanced
 as the universe demands the scales to move
regardless of what I think or for who or what I stand 
all I can do is watch the damage
 from the bench
 like Tyrese from the tunnel, 
feeling like I could have helped
 but trying to watch hurts my eyes
 and I must rest now
 as I hope this is not made into another trend 
but I know it will and all the guts that will wrench
 and I will want to spill out onto the concrete
 as so many other bodies who look like mine I’ve seen
As some White woman 
Who benefits more from affirmative action than me
Will inevitably try to steal and corrupt my style 
and pass it off as her own 
and when the chat calls it out
She will  do her best
To cry those dangerous tears
 as she is called out once again
 but because of what is between her legs
i still cannot bring myself to call her evil as she learned
 from my country to hate and take from me 
and the men will try to control her
definitely-not-just-once more 
having to once again
 become her own hero 
And she will somehow blame me
Falsely
 We are all guilty as the ledger keeps the score: 0.
 How many more? 四(sì), 死(sǐ), ¡si!
Another pattern. Fuck me.
</div>
<div class="stanza">
Our numbers will continue to fall, 
free while death bounces like the basketball, 
wheres the referee?
 The audience would call me 
a free throw merchant 
when nothing ever was fair for me
 and now its unfair for you too, 
so what’ll it be?
