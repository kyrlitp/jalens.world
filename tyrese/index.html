<div class="stanza active">
Tyrese Haliburton tore his Achilles last night  
and I couldn’t help but think of the O on his back  
being the letter of my hometown  
which is why Lillard wore it  
and the chances people thought the Celtics had  
of regaining their dynasty  
led by a man with a weird reverse corkscrew jumper  
</div>

<div class="stanza">
I wonder if Danny traded out of the first pick  
cuz Markelle rode motorcycles  
Jayson was tying ties instead  
My JSOC father, soul dead after Afghanistan,  
used to say first time is an occurrence,  
second time is a coincidence,  
third makes a pattern.  
</div>

<div class="stanza">
I couldn’t help but think of all the threes from thirty  
in all those big games Curry made  
and how Ty was about to do it to em  
and make em say what the hali—  
but the clock struck midnight on the Cinderella run  
</div>

<div class="stanza">
Like a bat out of hell I ran to Europe  
watching it all go into cinders  
as I scrunched my face up in disgust  
as Skip skipped the humanity of it all  
and called an Achilles tear  
an excuse for poor performance  
</div>

<div class="stanza">
And how the commissioner,  
who does not deserve in this moment to be named,  
put the bodies of Black folks once again over the billions  
and refused to reduce the number of games  
</div>

<div class="stanza">
And how I felt the same  
when my job pushed me  
harder and harder and harder  
over and over and over again  
across the edge  
until I broke like Ty, Dame, and Jayson too  
</div>

<div class="stanza">
How my real name is Jalen  
and once the golden child goes down  
you realize how expendable we all are  
regardless of how our mothers see us  
little boys with such big hearts  
</div>

<div class="stanza">
And how capitalism caused this  
and how the worst things propagate the fastest  
and how the wisest of my friends  
ended their own lives early  
</div>

<div class="stanza">
And the very thought of continuing  
on whatever this social trajector is  
makes me want to hurl all over my rose orange glasses  
that I have to wear now just to tell the masses:  
“I just can’t see quite right”  
</div>

<div class="stanza">
And how disgusting the right is for its very name  
because this is all so so wrong  
and how this must be made into song  
and demanded over and reprimanded over  
until the spell breaks  
on the human amnesia of the cost of greed
