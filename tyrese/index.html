`Tyrese Haliburton tore his Achilles last night and I couldn’t help but think of the O on his back being the letter of my hometown which is why Lillard wore it and the chances people thought the Celtics had of regaining their dynasty led by a man with a weird reverse corkscrew jumper and I wonder if Danny traded out of the first pick because Markelle rode motorcycles and Jayson was tying ties instead and my JSOC father always told me after he came back from Afghanistan, soul dead that first time is an occurrence second time is a coincidence and third makes a pattern and I couldn’t help but think of all of the threes from thirty in all those big games Curry made and how Ty was about to do it to em and make em say what the hali but the clock struck midnight on the Cinderella run and like a bat out of hell I ran to Europe watching it all go into cinders as I scrunched my face up in disgust as Skip skipped the humanity of it all and called one of the worst things that can ever happen to a young male athlete with everything to prove an excuse for poor performance and how the commissioner who does not deserve in this moment to be named put the bodies of black folks once again over the billions and refused to reduce the number of games and how I felt the same when my job pushed me harder and harder and harder over and over and over again across the edge taking advantage of my love of the game of music until I broke like Ty, Dame, and Jayson too and how my real name is Jalen similar to Boston´s second superstar and once the golden child goes down I realize how expendable we all are regardless of how our mothers see us and how capitalism caused this and how the worst things propagate the fastest and how the wisest of my friends ended their own lives early and how the very thought of continuing on whatever this social trajector makes me want to hurl all over my rose orange glasses that I have to tell the messes I just can’t see quite right anymore and how disgusting the right is for its very name because this is all so so wrong and how this must be made into song and demanded over and reprimanded over and over and over and over until the spell finally breaks on the human amnesia of the cost ofgreed and what more horror will we be bored to see until the Doomsday Clock reads all zeroes too and it becomes no longer a pattern but a fourcast like the Chinese had intuitively known fearing what comes after three - maybe we should listen finally for once to the foresight of those who came before us and mayb e not let so many despots swing clubs and shout fore! While the rabble sits in blue and black suits blue and black eyed, squabbling, quibbling who the GOAT really is, LeBron or Mike while we’re all being milked for sport by the teat and I can’t help but think about how all my family is lactose intolerant and the day will come where I need to eat a tablet to enjoy ice cream because we’re Black and what that even means because would Indy have had Haliburton’s back if he weren’t from Oshkosh a name they were familiar with because that’s where they got their tools from and it was only acceptable enough to put him on a billboard because his skin tone’s around the same as a pale-ish paper bag as his Dad definitely didn’t pass in the stands and could only shed a tear as the tears from the greek Gods turned to laughter as the Titans got their revenge on their newfound masters - money, greenbacks, I feel so green as an adult at 25 and my prefrontal cortex continues to solidify and I wonder why Draymond can’t get his shit together as all I fear is fear and disgust for what the wrinkled folk did to such young bodies forced to become old souls and I wish I could turn back time and warn Ty not to catch that pass and shake Obi by the shoulders and tell him it was never his fault he was only doing his job but that same sentence has left us unbalanced as the universe demands regardless of what I think or for who or what I stand and all I can do is watch the damage from the bench like Tyrese from the tunnel, feeling l;ike I could have helped buy trying to watch hurts my eyes and I must rest now as I hope this is not made into another trend but I know it will and all the guts that will wrench and I will want to spill out onto the concrete as so many other bodies who look like mine I’ve had to see on TV as some White woman benefits more from affirmative action than me as then will steal and corrupt my style and pass it off as her own and will cry those dangerous tears as she is called out once again but because of what is between her legs it will come to pass and the men will try to control her definitely-not-just-once more as the ledger keeps the score: 0. How many more? ¡si! 四(sì), 死(sǐ). 

Numbers fall while death bounces.`
